We present a historical review and an introduction about the light transport
problem in computer graphics. We analyze five Monte Carlo methods for solving
the Rendering Equation, them being Naive Path Tracing, Multiple Importance
Sampling, Bidirectional Path Tracing, Metropolis Light Transport and Gradient
Domain Path Tracing. We summarize the main ideas and optimal cases for each
method.
