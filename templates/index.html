            <em>Hello there!</em> I am <strong>Eduardo Renesto</strong>, a
            computer science and mathematics undergrad student at the Federal University
            of ABC (UFABC). 

            <br/>
            <br/>

            My main interests are computer graphics, operating systems and programming
            languages. My main languages are Rust, C and Haskell.

            <br/>
            <br/>

            I have done research in procedural geometry generation and data acquisition
            systems, with an emphasis in concurrency. I look forward to researching light
            transport algorithms.

            <br/>

            As a software engineer, I mostly do backend and systems programming.
